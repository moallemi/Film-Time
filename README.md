This app follows the MVVM architectural pattern.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Clone** the repository:
```shell
   git clone https://github.com/moallemi/Film-Time.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Sync the Gradle files and run the app!

## Development setup

First off, you require the latest [Android Studio Flamingo](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) (or newer) to be able to build the app.

### Code style

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), provided via
the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) gradle plugin, and the bundled project IntelliJ codestyle.

If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
easily fix it by running: `./gradlew spotlessApply`.

### API keys

You need to supply API / client keys for the various services the
app uses:

- [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org)
- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications)

You can find information about how to gain access [here](docs/API-Keys.md).

Add this to your system environment variables:

```shell
# Get this from TMDb
FILM_TIME_TMDB_API_KEY=<insert>
# Get these from Trakt
FILM_TIME_TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=<insert>
FILM_TIME_TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=<insert>
```

Do not forget to restart Android Studio to apply changes to your environment.
